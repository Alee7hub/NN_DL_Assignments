This repository consists of the tasks I did during the courses of Deep Learning Specialization. The solutions uploaded here are only for reference. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is. These courses took me behind the scene of DL algorithms and gave me great intuitions about the seemingly abstract concepts around DL for which I am grateful of the deeplearning.ai team, specially Andrew Ng.
